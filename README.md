# File Handler

It's a file handler: you input the folder path and the file name (with extension) and the script deletes it for you or opens the file.

It finds the file inside any subfolder so this is useful for that very specific case where you have an infinite folder and you need to access a specific thing, it saves you the trouble of navigating a large amount of subfolders.
