# FileDeleter

It's a file deleter: you input the folder name and the file name (with extension) and the script deletes it for you.

It finds the file inside any subfolder so this is useful for that very specific case where you have an infinite folder and you need to delete a specific thing, it saves you the trouble of navigating a large amount of subfolders.
